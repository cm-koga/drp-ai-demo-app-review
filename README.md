# drp-ai-demo-app
The DRP-AI AI accelerator from Renesas Electronics achieves high performance by performing AI inference as well as pre-processing in hardware.
This repository provides a demonstration application of DRP-AI that can be applied to real-world problems.


| Demonstration application | Architecture | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Body Measurement](BodyMeasurement/README.md) | [HRNET](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07919) | This application is designed to estimate human pose in captured images from distance data of a depth camera, and display the results such as height on an HDMI screen. |
| [River Level Monitor](RiverLevelMonitor/README.md) | [Deeplabv3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05587.pdf) and [YOLOX](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08430.pdf) | This application is designed to detect river objects in the images captured by the camera and display the flood risk of the river based on its area on the HDMI screen. |
