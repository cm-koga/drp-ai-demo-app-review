# River Level Monitor

## Application: Overview
This application is designed to detect river objects in the images captured by the camera and display the flood risk of the river based on its area on the HDMI screen.

This software could be useful in the labor-saving and efficiency aspects of river monitoring.
The AI model used for the sample application is [Deeplabv3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05587.pdf) .

>**Note 1:** When using the keyboard connected to RZ/V Evaluation Board, the keyboard layout and language are fixed to English.  
**Note 2:** For RZ/V2H EVK, there are USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports.  
MIPI camera needs to be connected to appropriate port based on its requirement.

## Application: Build Stage

>**Note:** User can skip to the [next stage (deploy)](#application-deploy-stage) if they do not want to build the application.  
All pre-built binaries are provided.

### Prerequisites
This section expects the user to have completed Step 5 of [Getting Started Guide](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/5.00/getting_started.html) provided by Renesas. 

After completion of the guide, the user is expected of following things.
- AI SDK setup is done.
- Following docker container is running on the host machine.
    | Docker container |
    |---|
    |`rzv2h_ai_sdk_container`  |

    >**Note:** Docker environment is required for building the sample application. 


### Application File Generation
1. On your host machine, copy the sources you want to build to the desired location. 

    1. Copy the source to be built to the `data` folder mounted in the Docker container.

        > /drp-ai_tvm/data/RiverLevelMonitor/src
    
2. Run (or start) the docker container and open the bash terminal on the container.  
    E.g., for RZ/V2H, use the `rzv2h_ai_sdk_container` as the name of container created from  `rzv2h_ai_sdk_image` docker image.  

   > Note that all the build steps/commands listed below are executed on the docker container bash terminal.  

3. Set your copy directory to the environment variable.  
    ```sh
    export PROJECT_PATH=/drp-ai_tvm/data/RiverLevelMonitor
    ```
4. Go to the application source code directory.  
    ```sh
    cd ${PROJECT_PATH}/src
    ```

5. Create and move to the `build` directory.
    ```sh
    mkdir -p build
    cd build
    ```
6. Build the application by following the commands below.  
      ```sh
      cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./toolchain/runtime.cmake -DV2H=ON ..
      make -j$(nproc)
      ```
7. The following application file would be generated in the `${PROJECT_PATH}/src/build` directory
   
    - app_river_level_monitor_cam


## Application: Deploy Stage
### Prerequisites
This section expects the user to have completed Step 7-1 of [Getting Started Guide](https://renesas-rz.github.io/rzv_ai_sdk/5.00/getting_started_v2h.html#step7) provided by Renesas. 

After completion of the guide, the user is expected of following things.
- microSD card setup is done.

### File Configuration
For the ease of deployment all the deployables file and folders are provided in [exe](./exe) 

The folder contains following items. 
|File | Details |
|---|---|
|licecnses | License information of AI model. <br>Not necessary for running application. |
|deeplabv3_cam | Model object files for deployment.<br>Pre-processing Runtime Object files included. |
|app_river_level_monitor_cam | application file. |

### Instruction
1. Copy the following files to the `/home/root/tvm` directory of the rootfs (SD Card) for the board.
    |File | Details |
    |---|---|
    |All files in [exe](./exe) directory | Including `deploy.so` file. |
    |`app_river_level_monitor_cam` application file | Generated the file according to [Application File Generation](#application-file-generation) |
    |`Config.ini` file | Threshold settings file. |
    |`Param.ini` file | River area retention file. |

2. Check if `libtvm_runtime.so` exists under `/usr/lib64` directory of the rootfs (SD card) on the board.

3. Folder structure in the rootfs (SD Card) would look like:
    ```sh
    ├── usr/
    │   └── lib64/
    │       └── libtvm_runtime.so
    └── home/
        └── root/
            └── tvm/ 
                ├── yolox_cam/
                │   ├── preprocess
                │   ├── deploy.json
                │   ├── deploy.params
                │   └── deploy.so
                ├── deeplabv3_cam/
                │   ├── preprocess
                │   ├── deploy.json
                │   ├── deploy.params
                │   └── deploy.so
                ├── Config.ini
                ├── Param.ini
                └── app_river_level_monitor_cam
    ```
>**Note:** The directory name could be anything instead of `tvm`. If you copy the whole [exe](./exe) folder on the board, you are not required to rename it `tvm`.

    On application window, following information is displayed.  
    - Camera capture  
    - Segmentation result (River area segmentation, Bounding boxes, class name and score.)  
        - River Area : Displays the ratio of river area to the saved normal river.
        - Display Alert : `Normal water level`  or `CAUTION WATER LEVEL`  or `WARNING WATER LEVEL`  or `HAZARD WATER LEVEL` .

    - Processing time  
        - Total AI Time (DeepLabv3) : Sum of all processing time below.

4. Save normal river area. ("s" + `Enter` key).  
    ```sh
    s
    ```
    Save current river area as a threshold to determine the warning level to Param.ini.

    - Display Alert  
        - If the area of ​​the river area exceeds the threshold after saving, an alert will be displayed.  
          - caution-per-rate=120 [%] : If exceeded, `CAUTION WATER LEVEL` will be displayed.  
          - warning-per-rate=160 [%] : If exceeded, `WARNING WATER LEVEL` will be displayed.  
          - hazard-per-rate=200 [%] : If exceeded, `HAZARD WATER LEVEL` will be displayed.  
          - other than that :`Normal water level` will be displayed.  
    

    | WARNING WATER LEVEL |
